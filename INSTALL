         Installation instructions for Module::Build

To install this module, you have two choices.  You can either do:

  perl Build.PL
  ./Build test
  ./Build install  (this step may need to be done as root)

or if you really want to, you can do

  perl Makefile.PL
  make test
  make install     (this step may need to be done as root)

If you do the Makefile.PL option, you'll actually be using the
Build.PL option under the surface with a pass-through Makefile.

I recommend using the Build.PL option.

There's heaps more information in the README and in the documentation
of the various packages in this distribution.
