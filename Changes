Revision history for Perl extension Module::Build.

0.04
  - Added a 'manifest' action.  It's just like MakeMaker's 'make manifest', it
    brings your MANIFEST file up to date with your distribution directory.

  - Reorganized some of the responsibilities of various methods, which
    allows modules to be built and tested programmatically.

  - The 'clean' action will now clean up files that were created more
    recently than the on-disk cleanup registry was written.

  - Undefined values from Config.pm are handled correctly now.

  - The dispatch() method will now accept explicit dispatch
    parameters, for use in a programmatic setting.

  - $ENV{TEST_VERBOSE} will be set in test scripts if the 'verbose=1'
    parameter is set.

  - Moved the test.pl script to t/basic.t

  - Created the t/xs.t script, which tests building a module with a
    .xs component.

  - Fixed the loading of $^O-specific modules (there were no such
    modules before).

  - Added a 'darwin' platform module, which removes -flat_namespace
    from $Config{ccflags} while building .xs modules (it's a linker
    flag, not a compiler flag).

  - Now uses $^W instead of the 'warnings' pragma, which apparently
    provides compatibility with perl 5.005 (I've only tested it with
    5.6.x myself).

  - If a file called C<visual.pl> exists in the top-level directory,
    this file will be executed as a Perl script during 'Build test' and
    its output will be shown to the user.  This is a good place to put
    speed tests or other tests that don't use the C<Test::Harness> format
    for output.

  - The 'Build install' step will now put .xs-related things in the
    correct architecture-dependent libraries.

  - Added the 'autosplit' option, even though I think autosplitting is
    a load of hooie.

  - The 'perl Build.PL' step will now detect whether the current
    environment is "unixish", "windowsish", etc., and load the correct
    module (i.e. Module::Build::Platform::Unix).  More specific
    modules may also be written for particular values of $^O.

  - Module::Build will now process any .xs files in the lib/
    directory.  Please let me know whether this works or not with your
    distribution & platform.  I'll be trying out various distributions
    on my platform.

  - Corrected some embarassing errors in the POD documentation.  Also
    added a long documentation section on the various build actions
    (test, install, build, etc.) and added some neato ASCII art.

  - Added a 'cleanup' mechanism - any method may call the
    $self->add_to_cleanup(@files) method to register files which need
    to be cleaned up during 'Build clean'.

  - Added a 'Build help' action that gives a little syntax help, and
    lists all the actions available.

  - Fixed a bug in which 'blib/' wasn't properly being added to @INC
    when running 'Build test'.

  - For the 'Build dist' action, we'll use the 'tar' and 'gzip'
    programs (as specified by Config.pm) on Unix platforms, otherwise
    we'll use Archive::Tar and Compress::Zlib.

  - Added POD documentation.

  - Added the 'install', 'fakeinstall', and 'dist' actions.

  - new() will now determine version string based on 'module_version', or
    'module_version_from', or 'module_name', in that order.

  - Module::Build::Base handles its file paths in a platform-independent
    way, using the File:: modules
